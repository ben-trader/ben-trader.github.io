    <h1>My name is Ben Trader</h1>
    <h3>I'm a Strategic Communication major from Golden, Colorado.</h3>
    <h3>I mountain bike and ski and I also sit on my ass and do jack shit a lot</h3>

    <h1>About</h1>
    <h3>I'm a third year (or maybe fourth who knows at this point) student at CU boulder and I've lived in CO my whole life.</h3>
    <h3>This is my second time taking this class because I did not meet the minimum grade for my minor by 2%. Love that!</h3>
    <h3>Yeah thats about it I guess.</h3>

    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <h3>I love learning about bikes, computers, and cannabis (unfortunately for my mom haha).</h3>
    <h3>I have been biking for almost 19 years now, and that's a huge part of my life.</h3>
    <h3>I have been interested in computers for a super long time as well, since maybe middle school.</h3>
    <h3>I have recently been very interested in cannabis culture and cannabis science as well, although there are no courses at Boulder from what I can tell that focus on either of those.</h3>

    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <h3>I want to graduate CU Boulder with my degree, and then my only goal past that is be happy. I want to be able to be happy in life.</h3>
    <h3>I think thats the best goal anyone can have.</h3>

    <h1>Contact</h1>
    <h3>You can not reach me</h3>
    <h3>303-382-5633 is not my number</h3>
    <h3>ceo@business.net is not my email</h3>

    <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
    <h3>Thought it would be easier to put here</h3>
    <h3>I think that I will include the information that has been included here :3</h3>
    <h3>I think that the only people who will ever visit this site will be my Professor and my TA, and for the sole purpose of grading me haha</h3>
    <h3>I will organize my content into points under headers</h3>
    <h3>Okay so just immediately off rip I found like the coolest website to ever exist.</h3>
    <a href="https://bryantcodes.art/">Bryant Codes</a>
    <h3>Super big fan of whatever this is. Really fun to use and it just looks really cool.</h3>
    <h3>Then I found this one.</h3>
    <a href="https://peteroravec.com/">Peter Oravec</a>
    <h3>This one is a really cool concept and actually works really well and is fun to use.</h3>
    <h3>I'm beginning to pick up on a common theme here though (shit I can't code).</h3>
    <h3>Finally I saw this</h3>

    <h3>I think this is the pinnacle of web development tbh. Doens't get much better than this.</h3>
    <h1>â€Ž </h1>
    <h3>I realistically don't want to include that much information on this website, as I really have no use for it.</h3>
    <h3>I haven't even posted on my social media accounts in years. I don't really put myself out there online that much.</h3>
    <h3>I guess the only concerns I have are with others judging me for what I put online.</h3>
